A brief overview of my biomedical engineering project submitted to the 2019 TDI Fellowship challenge.   


*Full data-sets, R.scripts, and R Notebooks of the project are included in this repository.* 


DATA-SETS DESCRIPTION & NOTES    
  
HEMODYNAMIC DATA-SET    
"Scan" indicates the time of CT scan imaging (Scan == 1 #Baseline, Scan == 2 #6 weeks, Scan == 3 #6 months)    
"d mm" is distance in millimiters    
"area" is the cross sectional area in mm^2    
"WSSave" and "WSSmax" are average and maximum wall shrear stress in Pascals    
"WSSGave" is the average wall shear stress gradient in 1/Pascals    
"OSI" is the oscillatory shear index (no units)    

*Abbreviations:*    
WSS = wall shear stress    
Ave = average   
G = gradient    


GENOMIC DATA-SET    
*Abbreviations:*    
B = baseline     
2W = 2 weeks
