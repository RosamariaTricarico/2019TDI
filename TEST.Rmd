The average fold change of gene expression from baseline and p-value are calculated for each gene and displayed in the Volcano plot. Marked in black are the genes with p-value > .01 and fold change > 1.3 to identify those which might play a role during fistula remodeling and adaption.
The number of genes with larger expression variation is equal to 42; the list of genes is saved in the array "Significant".
